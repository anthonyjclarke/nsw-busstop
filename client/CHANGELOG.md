# Changelog — CYD_BusStop_NSW Client

**This project is a thin-client rewrite of the original CYD_BusStop_NSW.** The ESP32
no longer calls TfNSW APIs directly. It fetches pre-processed bus data from a
companion NAS server (`nsw-busstop-server` — Python FastAPI) over plain HTTP.
The server must be running on your local network for this device to display any data.

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.
Format: `## [version] YYYY-MM-DD` — sections: Added · Changed · Fixed.

## [0.5.1] 2026-04-04

### Added
- Offline footer indicator on the TFT: when the NAS fetch fails, the bottom
  status line now shows `SERVER OFFLINE` before `upd HH:MM` while cached
  departure data continues to age locally.

### Changed
- `fetchAllStops()` now returns success/failure so the main loop can keep the
  last successful fetch time unchanged on server errors instead of showing a
  misleading fresh timestamp.

### Fixed
- NAS URL config first-boot behaviour: `getNasUrl()` now creates and seeds the
  `busstop2` NVS namespace with `NAS_DEFAULT_URL` when it does not yet exist,
  removing the spurious `prefs.begin(readonly) failed` warning.

---

## [0.5.0] 2026-04-04

### Changed
- **NAS thin-client rewrite:** `fetchAllStops()` now makes a single
  `GET /api/state` call to the NAS server instead of 4 direct TfNSW API calls.
  Removes all TfNSW API constants, `DeChunkStream` chunked-transfer wrapper,
  `parseISODatetime` helper, and `WiFiClientSecure` dependency from the client.
- Replaced all `DynamicJsonDocument` with `StaticJsonDocument` throughout
  `bus_api.cpp` and `web_server.cpp` — eliminates heap fragmentation from
  repeated alloc/free on every poll and browser request.
- NVS key helpers `stopIdKey()` / `stopNameKey()` in `config.cpp` now use
  stack `char` buffers via `snprintf` instead of heap-allocated `String`.
- Log line in `fetchAllStops()` uses stack `char` buffer instead of double
  `String` construction.

### Added
- Hour formatting for departures >=60 minutes: displays `{h}h{mm}m` (e.g.
  "1h05m") instead of raw minute count.
- `lastFetchMs` is now set on each successful NAS fetch — `fetchAge` in
  `/api/state` WebUI response now reports real values instead of `-1`.

### Fixed
- Vertical divider overdraw: `drawFastVLine` length was `240` (drew 28px past
  screen bottom); corrected to `240 - HEADER_H` (212px).
- Removed `fetchStop()` declaration from `bus_api.h` — function was deleted but
  declaration remained, causing potential linker issues.
- Removed unused `epochPlanned` field from `Departure` struct — was declared
  but never assigned or read.
- Fixed stale comments in `web_server.h` (referenced ArduinoOTA handling that
  was moved to `main.cpp`).

## [0.4.0] 2026-04-04

### Changed
- Moved to monorepo: client now lives in `client/` alongside `server/`
- Repository: `nsw-busstop` (was `CYD_BusStop_NSW`)
- Server component included in same repo — no separate clone needed
- Added `secrets.h.example` template for first-time setup
- Rewrote README.md and CLAUDE.md for client-only context with cross-references

---

## Things to do / Enhancements

- Add client-side validation for stop ID (numeric only, max length) and stop
  name length before submitting.
- Support adding/removing stops dynamically (up to `STOP_COUNT`) in the UI and
  potentially in runtime config.
- Add UI feedback on validation errors in the editor form and disable save when
  invalid.
- Add secure admin access to web config endpoints (password / token) to prevent
  unauthorized changes.
- Add optional zone and stop name autocomplete using TfNSW lookup endpoint.
- Add a dedicated `/config` page in WebUI for full device settings (poll
  interval, display brightness, timezone, etc.)
- Add full config page in WebUI, including system diagnostics.
- Persist brightness setting across reboots via NVS.
- Add staleness indicator when NAS has been unreachable for > N seconds.
- Move `fetchAllStops()` to a FreeRTOS task — currently blocks the main loop
  for ~50-200ms (LAN HTTP), leaving OTA and web requests unresponsive.

## [0.2.4] 2026-04-03

### Added
- TfNSW departure parsing now captures:
  - real-time control flag (`isRealtimeControlled`)
  - planned vs estimated departure epochs and delay in seconds
  - destination name (e.g. "Gladesville - Jordan St")
  - first service alert subtitle per stop
- TFT real-time indicators per departure row:
  - green filled circle (`●`) for GPS-tracked live departures
  - grey tilde (`~`) for scheduled-only departures
- TFT and WebUI day abbreviation (Mon, Tue, etc.) for non-today departures
  instead of showing large minute counts
- WebUI per-departure `LIVE`/`SCHED` badge based on real-time status
- WebUI delay pill: `+4m late` (orange) or `3m early` (green), suppressed
  below ±2 min to filter GPS noise
- WebUI destination column per departure row
- WebUI amber alert banner when TfNSW returns service disruption info
- `isLocalToday()`, `formatLocalDayAbbr()`, `getLocalTZOffset()`,
  `getLogTimeStr()` helpers in `time_mgr`
- `/api/state` now includes `tzOff` (TZ offset in seconds) for client-side
  local-day calculation
- Wall-clock timestamps in debug log output (local HH:MM:SS after NTP sync,
  uptime fallback before sync)
- `maxBlk` (largest contiguous free heap block) in fetch and init log lines
- `performBusRefresh()` helper in `main.cpp` to deduplicate fetch+draw logic
- `consumeStopRefreshRequest()` mechanism so WebUI stop edits queue a refresh
  back to the main loop instead of fetching inside the async handler

### Changed
- "Now" departure colour changed from red to orange on both TFT and WebUI for
  better visual distinction from "Gone" (red, WebUI only)
- WebUI poll interval reduced from 60s to 15s; render interval from 15s to 5s
  — WebUI now stays closer to TFT update cadence
- `fetchStop()` now collects up to 8 departures, sorts by estimated epoch, and
  keeps the 3 soonest — fixes out-of-order display when buses run early/late
- `/api/state` response includes `rt`, `delay`, `dest` per departure and
  `alert` per stop
- WebUI layout: departure rows now have distinct columns for route, badge,
  destination, delay pill, minutes/day label, and clock time
- WebUI stop edit POST now queues a refresh instead of calling `fetchAllStops()`
  directly in the async handler (non-blocking)
- WebUI stop edit POST logs individual field changes and detects no-op saves
- Delay logged in minutes (`delay:+4m`) instead of seconds
- Default stop names updated: "To Meadowbank Stn", "To Macquarie Park"
- Debug macros use `dbgTimestamp()` with wall-clock output via `getLogTimeStr()`

### Removed
- Temporary diagnostic fetch (`DIAG_FETCH`) code and build flag

---

## [0.2.3] 2026-04-02

### Added
- Runtime-configurable stop list via WebUI:
  - `initStopConfig()` loads persisted stops from NVS (`Preferences`) or falls
    back to built-in defaults.
  - `stopIds[]/stopNames[]` runtime arrays replace hardcoded `STOP_IDS`/`STOP_NAMES`
    for fetch/display and API references.
  - `GET /api/stops` returns the current stop id/name array.
  - `POST /api/stops` accepts JSON array to update the stop list (up to
    `STOP_COUNT` entries), persists with `saveStopConfig()`, and triggers
    `fetchAllStops()`.
  - `POST /api/stops/reset` restores defaults and refreshes data.
- Minimal WebUI stop editor on `/`:
  - "Edit stops" toggle reveals editable stop ID/name fields.
  - Save and reset buttons with status messages.
  - Client JS syncs with API and updates the live stops display.

## [0.2.2] 2026-04-02

### Added
- "upd HH:MM" last-fetch indicator — dim grey, bottom-right corner, Font 2.
  Sits in the 16 px gap (y=224–239) below the last departure row. Redrawn
  after every `drawAllStops()` call; only changes value on actual API fetch.

---

## [0.2.1] 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- Bus departure clock times displayed in UTC instead of local Sydney time.
  TfNSW API returns timestamps in UTC; `clockTime` was extracted directly from
  the raw ISO string (`dtStr + 11`) giving UTC HH:MM. Fix: derive `clockTime`
  via `formatLocalHHMM()` which uses ezTime's `myTZ.dateTime(epoch, UTC_TIME)`
  to convert the stored UTC epoch to AEDT/AEST before display.

---

## [0.2.0] 2026-04-01

### Added
- De-chunking stream wrapper (`DeChunkStream`) for reliable TfNSW API parsing
  — handles chunked transfer-encoding that the API always sends, regardless of
  HTTP/1.0 request; zero heap buffer allocation
- Live countdown: `recalcMinutes()` recalculates minutes-until from stored
  departure epoch every 15s on TFT and client-side in WebUI
- "Now" label (red) when a bus is 0 minutes away on both TFT and WebUI
- "Gone" label (red) in WebUI for departed buses
- WebUI live dashboard at `/` — dark theme, polls `/api/state` every 60s,
  JS recalculates minutes every 15s, shows "Updated Xs ago"
- `/api/state` now includes `now` (UTC epoch), `fetchAge` per stop, and
  `epoch` per departure for client-side recalculation
- `&limit=6` added to TfNSW API query string to request fewer results

### Changed
- Replaced ElegantOTA with ArduinoOTA (framework built-in, no extra library)
- Replaced `me-no-dev/ESP Async WebServer` + `AsyncTCP` with maintained
  `mathieucarbou/ESPAsyncWebServer` + `AsyncTCP` via GitHub URL refs
- Added `-DLOAD_GLCD=1`, `-DLOAD_FONT2=1`, `-DLOAD_FONT4=1` build flags
  — built-in fonts were not compiled without these, causing blank TFT text
- `NTP_SERVER` constant renamed to `NTP_HOST` to avoid macro collision with
  ezTime's `#define NTP_SERVER`
- `Departure` struct now stores `epochUTC` for live recalculation
- WebUI root page changed from server-rendered HTML to PROGMEM + JS polling

### Fixed
- TFT display showing grid lines but no text (missing LOAD_FONT build flags)
- Heap fragmentation causing stops 3–4 to fail with `IncompleteInput`
  (replaced large `getString()` buffer with streaming de-chunk parser)
- `fetchAllStops()` printf missing `STOP_COUNT` argument — printed stack garbage
- Duplicate ArduinoOTA initialisation (was in both `main.cpp` and `web_server.cpp`)

---
